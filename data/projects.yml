  description: A fun and interactive task management app for children and their parents. For this final project, I was the lead developer in a team of 4. We used Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS, API's, and Devise to create this app. Creating an active and fun learning environment for children involves turning education into an exciting adventure, where curiosity is sparked, and knowledge is gained through interactive and enjoyable activities. It's all about making learning a thrilling journey filled with discovery and joy!
