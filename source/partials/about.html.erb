        <div class="p-container">
          <p>I'm a Japanese citizen but I spent the majority of my early years in the USA.</p>
          <p>I'm a Web Developer in Tokyo as well as a Computer Science student at SNHU. I started off self-learning how to code and then became a student as well. Since then, I've also graduated from Le Wagon Tokyo and learned some really cool stuff.
            Creating and designing are things that I am passionate about.</p>
